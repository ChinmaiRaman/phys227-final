# phys227-final

**Author:** Chinmai Raman

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChinmaiRaman/phys227-final.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChinmaiRaman/phys227-final)

## Specification

Complete the following exercises for your final, placing your solutions into ```final.py```. Write the solutions as callable functions, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```Final.ipynb``` that imports your python file and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.
